<!-- Paragraph about Alan -->
	<h2>He</h2>
<p>Alan, son of Jiann-Song and May-lin, was born in Taipei Taiwan. He lived there till he was 6 years old and shortly after attending a semester of first grade, moved to Kendall Park, New Jersey. Alan received his bachelor&rsquo;s degree from the Pennsylvania State University in 2006 with a degree in Electrical Engineering.</p>
<p>He had heard many stories about the sunny weather on the west coast and always wanted to move there one day to get away from the dreaded winters back east. After graduating college, he quickly landed a job at Boeing and took the opportunity to start a new life in Seattle. He did not realized until he got there that unlike California, Seattle actually rains 9 months out of the year.</p>
<p>After spending 7 years in Seattle, Alan has grown accustomed to the persistent rainfall, and loves living in the great northwest. It was also here in Seattle where Alan had the chance to fall in love with his lovely wife, Jewel.</p>

<!-- Paragraph about Jewel -->
	<h2>She</h2>
<p>
Jewel, daughter of Cheng-Hsuan and Wei-An, was born in Taipei Taiwan. She has lived in Taipei all her life, but her love for travel and adventure led her to visit many foreign cities such as Tokyo, Vancouver, and Signapore. Jewel received her bachelor&rsquo;s degree from the National Central University in 2011 with a degree in Geophysics.
</p>
<p>
In 2012, she ventured to Seattle to experience the American culture and had plans to further advance her education in the U.S. During her short time in Seattle, Jewel had the opportunity to try many new things. She especially enjoyed hiking the mountains of the Pacific Northwest and developed a passion for rock climbing.
</p>
<p>
Though Jewel had not expected to be romantically involved, love comes when you least expect it. She was swept off her feet by Alan shortly after her arrival in Seattle.
