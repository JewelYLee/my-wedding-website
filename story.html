<!-- Paragraph about How me met -->
<h2>Story of how we met...</h2>
<p>
Alan and Jewel first met on April 7, 2012. Alan was living in Seattle, and working for Boeing. Jewel had just completed her first semester of grad school at NTU. She took the spring semester off to visit Seattle while she contemplated the possibility of studying abroad.
</p>
<p>
Alan first laid eyes on Jewel at Earls, a restaurant in Bellevue. Alan was attending a friend&rsquo;s birthday dinner that night. It was a large group of about 30 people, so seating was chaotic. Jewel, her sister Kate, and two others came late to the party and sat at their own table. At the time, Alan did not know they were also there for the party. From the moment Jewel walked in, Alan couldn&rsquo;t stop from glancing over to her table.
</p>
<p>
The two finally had a chance to meet after dinner when the party was moved to Lucky Strike, a bowling and arcade entertainment lounge. Alan worked up the courage to talk to Jewel, and he learned that she was visiting from Taiwan for a few months. At the end of the night, he figured that was the end of that and they would never see each other again.
</p>
<p>
Coincidentally, they bump into each other the following Monday at the Bellevue Square Mall. It must have been fate! As anyone who knew Alan knows that he rarely went to the mall. It just so happens he had to return an item at the Apple store that day. Alan wasn&rsquo;t sure if Jewel would remember him since they only briefly talked that day. Little did he know, Jewel had also taken notice of Alan that very night when she first arrived at Earls.
</p>
<p>
Over the course of the next few weeks, the two hung out together with Kate and the rest of Alan&rsquo;s friends. Alan had been nervous to ask Jewel out on an official date. Since things were going so smoothly, Alan wanted to take it slow and just enjoy the moment. It wasn&rsquo;t until June when they went on a trip to Las Vegas together where Alan surprised Jewel with their first date. They have been together ever since.
