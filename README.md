##version 1.0 Last update: Jan. 4 2014

This is my wedding website. It's my very first hand-coded website and also my final project for UW Course "Web Design and Development Foundations" (09, 2013 - 01, 2014)

Besides the html + CSS codes, I designed the graphics used in this website as well (Mr. potato and Miss Strawberry). I use Wacom pen tablet with free software "Sketchbook Express" which I got for 2014 christmas gift from Alan:) 

At that time I did't know how to use grid and had no idea about responsive web design. So I used table to align my content and my code looks terrible. However, it's my first website!

Btw, Alan &amp; Jewel Wedding day is on April 26, 2014 in Taipei, Taiwan! 

Thanks for reading.
